            <p>
              Since I started my career as a UI developer, I have built a wide
              experience in designing, developing, testing and improving
              applications and websites, covering definition, semantic
              structure, design and programming processes with a collaborative
              work style and in a fast-paced work environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Experienced on agency, startup and client side and with a
              result-oriented performance , I have been involved in several
              product UI design and development projects, including sketching,
              information architecture, visual elements and interaction patterns
              of interface elements and developing solid skills in HTML5 markup,
              CSS3, responsive web, semantic web analysis and logical order of
              cascade sheets.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will find me to be a curious and strong analytical problem
              solver with a focus on continuous learning, keeping up-to-date on
              new technologies and adding value to projects and customers. As a
              result of my approach, in my last position I covered processes of
              front-end development with Javascript using Backbone / React
              technologies and of back-end development in Node JS, focused on
              REST API with Express framework and MongoDB database and including
              a continuous integration by using Circle / Docker and agile
              methodologies under Scrum.
